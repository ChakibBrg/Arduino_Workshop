# Competition Description

## Practical Part: Correct the Circuit

**System Description**:  
Create a system that, upon a button click, starts taking distance measurements. The system should turn the green LED on if the distance is above a certain threshold; otherwise, it should turn the red LED on. It should also display the distance on an LCD. The system should turn off when the button is clicked again.

**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Tool**: Tinkercad

**Missions**:
- Correct the circuit mistakes and the code. Spot all the problems!
- The push button is not wired at all, and the logic of the code does not account for the ON/OFF mechanism.

**Grading**: 
- A fully functional system will earn full marks directly.
- Otherwise, one point is given for each mistake or missing feature.
