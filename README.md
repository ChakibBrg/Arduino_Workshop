## Event Recap

### **Friday, 06 December 2024 - Introduction to IoT, Arduinos, and Simulator (Online)**
On Friday, we kicked off the event with an online session covering the basics of the **Internet of Things (IoT)** and an introduction to **Arduino boards** and their components. Participants learned how to simulate circuits using **Tinkercad**, which helped everyone get started with virtual experiments.

Topics covered included:
- Understanding IoT and its applications.
- Overview of Arduino boards and components.
- How to use the Tinkercad simulator to design virtual circuits.

### **Saturday, 07 December 2024 - Hands-on Arduino Coding and Projects**

The second day was packed with hands-on activities and project building:

#### **1. Introduction to Arduino Coding Principles**
We started by covering the fundamental coding principles behind Arduino programming. Participants learned how to write basic sketches using C/C++ and understood how these principles apply to real Arduino projects.

#### **2. Basic Circuits with LEDs and Pushbuttons**
In this session, everyone practiced designing basic circuits with LEDs and pushbuttons:
- Controlling LEDs using code.
- Setting up and using pushbuttons to toggle LED states.
- Circuit assembly and troubleshooting.

#### **3. Using Sensors in Arduino Projects**
Participants learned how to work with sensors and how to read data from them:
- **Light Sensor**: Used to measure light intensity.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Used for measuring distance via sound waves.
- **DHT22**: A sensor for measuring temperature and humidity.

#### **4. Introduction to Bluetooth Modules**
We explored wireless communication by introducing Bluetooth modules (**HC-05/HC-06**) and showed how to create communication between Arduino and mobile devices.
